# Utility-Bill_Charges-Extraction
This is a work in progress of mine. The purpose of this application is to automatically extract all relevant electrical charges related to charging an EV at my residence.

# Iteration 1
Using Python, the user will need to upload a pdf of the utility bill and input an integer of total kWh taken by the EV for the month.
